# Dual-tone-multi-frequency-signaling
Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) is a telecommunication signaling system using the voice-frequency band over telephone lines between telephone equipment and other communications devices and switching centers.

In this project, we decode the phone numbers from its voice. We use the Fourier series to analyze the signal in the frequency domain.

- More detail about DTMF and use of Fourier series is provided in `SS_HW5.pdf` (page 10-14).
